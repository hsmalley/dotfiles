### Package supplied configuration settings
##### All lines starting with # are comments
##### All other lines should be of the form keyword=value

##### Shell Behavior Defaults
### NOTE: verbose and paramiko_log_level settings are obsolete
### Use loglevel instead, and logging from both RadSSH and paramiko get captured to radssh.log
###
### loglevel can be set to [CRITICAL|ERROR|WARNING|INFO|DEBUG]
# loglevel=ERROR

# shell.prompt=RadSSH $
shell.console=formatters.ansi256
### To see last few lines of output of in-flight jobs when pressing Ctrl-C
### set this parameter to the number of lines to retain. Can be very memory
### intensive.
# stalled_job_buffer=0
### Report when command entered is modified (by a plugin) prior to executing
# show_altered_commands=off

max_threads=1000
### Automatically save log files into date/time-stamped local directory
logdir=~/.radssh_sessions/session_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S
### Log all normal output to given filename in logdir. Set empty to turn off
### NOTE: This logging is in addition to host-by-host logging
# log_out=out.log
### Log all error output to given filename in logdir. Set empty to turn off
### NOTE: This is in addition to host-by-host error logging
# log_err=err.log

### Command line history file, saved across sessions
historyfile=~/.radssh_history

### Available modes: {stream, ordered, off}
# output_mode=stream
### Can override character encoding (will use sys.stdout.encoding if not specified)
### character_encoding=UTF-8
### Avoiding runaway commands with either too much output, or
### waiting indefinately at a user prompt...
# quota.time=0
# quota.lines=0
# quota.bytes=0

### Connection & Authentication Options
### Username defaults to $SSH_USER (or $USER) if not set here
### username=root
### Supplemental authentication file for more keys and/or passwords
# authfile=~/.radssh_auth

### Network Tweaks
socket.timeout=30
keepalive=180

### Extensions to the shell via plugins
### System plugin collections always loaded from ${EXEC}/plugins
### User plugins loaded from directories listed here (optional)
plugins=~/svn/scripts/radssh/radssh/LN_plugins
### Selectively disable plugins, if for some reason you want to
### avoid loading some system (or user) plugins that normally load
# disable_plugins=

### Options hostkey.verify and hostkey.known_hosts are obsoleted
### in favor of using standard SSH Config settings StrictHostKeyChecking
### and UserKnownHostsFile. RadSSH can use a different config settings
### file by overriding the path to 'ssh_config' here:
ssh_config=~/.ssh/config

### Enable loading of user specific settings (and command line options)
### Only if this is set.
user.settings=~/.radssh_config

### Rudimentary command safeguards
### First, outright forbid commands that should only be run with a TTY
### which RadSSH typically does not provide...
# commands.forbidden=telnet,ftp,sftp,vi,vim,ssh
### Also, for commands that could have devastating side effects, have
### RadSSH prompt the user if they are 100% sure they want to run...
# commands.restricted=rm,reboot,shutdown,halt,poweroff,telinit

### Some SSH hosts do not support exec_command invocation, and require
### a session to be used via invoke_shell() instead. In addition, based
### on observation, the underlying transport is terminated when the session
### is closed, so the open session MUST stay persistent across command
### invocations.
### Identify such "problem" hosts by their SSH Server version string, which
### can be gathered using ssh-keyscan.
# force_tty=Cisco,force10networks
### In addition, allow custom command(s) to be issued at signon and signoff
### to permit session to behave as RadSSH expects, without user input...
# force_tty.signon=term length 0
# force_tty.signoff=term length 20

### Should RadSSH initially send auth_none request (needed for OpenSSH 4.3 banner)
# try_auth_none=off
